# GameShelf

This web app helps users manages their games, whether the are currently playing them, have them on their wishlist, or have already completed them. Users can create and manage accounts, add games to their library, set their status as **Playing** or **Completed** and add game to their wishlist.

The app also allows users to filter games by genre, platform, or status and to rate games or add personal notes. In addition, it serves as forum where can share personal reviews and discuss their favorite games with the community.

Honestly, I'm very excited about this project. Though it is relatively simple, it's the first time creating something like this entirely on my own.
